COMPLETED TASK: Implementing Shopping Cart Checkout Flow

STATUS: ✅ Completed

TASK DESCRIPTION:
Completed the shopping cart checkout integration with Stripe. The cart UI and state management were already implemented, but the checkout flow in CartPanel was incomplete. This task completes the critical path from adding items to cart through Stripe checkout, making the entire shopping experience functional.

COMPLETED STEPS:
1. ✅ Created inprogress.txt document
2. ✅ Fixed CartPanel checkout flow:
   - Added missing `isProcessing` state variable
   - Added `isSignedIn` check using `useUser` hook from Clerk
   - Integrated `createCheckoutSession` action from Convex
   - Implemented checkout handler that:
     - Validates user authentication
     - Extracts item IDs from cart
     - Calls Stripe checkout session creation
     - Redirects to Stripe checkout URL
     - Clears cart before redirect
     - Handles errors gracefully
3. ✅ Verified implementation with `bunx convex dev --once`
   - All Convex functions compiled successfully
   - No TypeScript or linter errors
4. ✅ Updated missing-functionality-spec.md:
   - Marked Section 7 (Shopping Cart Functionality) as complete
   - Updated all cart-related checkboxes to implemented
   - Updated summary statistics (8 fully complete categories, ~75% progress)
   - Updated priority recommendations to reflect completed items
5. ✅ Updated this inprogress.txt with completion status

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- CartPanel now uses `useAction` hook to call `createCheckoutSession` action
- Authentication check redirects to sign-in if user is not authenticated
- Checkout button shows loading state during processing
- Checkout button is disabled when user is not signed in
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Cart is cleared before redirecting to Stripe (items will be marked as sold via webhook)

CHECKOUT FLOW:
1. User clicks "Proceed to Checkout" button
2. System checks if user is authenticated
3. If not authenticated, redirects to sign-in page
4. If authenticated, creates Stripe checkout session with cart items
5. Redirects user to Stripe checkout page
6. After payment, Stripe webhook updates order and item statuses
7. User is redirected back to success/cancel page

FILES MODIFIED:
- `src/components/CartPanel.tsx` - Completed checkout flow implementation
- `docs/missing-functionality-spec.md` - Updated to reflect cart completion
- `inprogress.txt` - Documented work completed

VERIFICATION:
- ✅ Convex functions compile successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All cart functionality now complete

NEXT MOST IMPORTANT TASK:
Based on the missing functionality spec, the next most important task would be:

**Authentication Enhancements (Section 4.2)**:
- User profile creation on first login (automatic sync with Convex users table)
- This is a high-priority item that's partially complete
- Currently, user profile creation exists but may not be automatically triggered on first login

ALTERNATIVE NEXT STEPS:
- Owner Dashboard (Section 2.3) - Optional but recommended for garage owners
- Order history view (Section 5.3) - Complete the payment UI section
- PWA capabilities (Section 8.2) - Service worker and offline support
- Error handling improvements (Section 12) - Better user feedback with toast notifications
